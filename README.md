The Plant Seedling Classification project aims to accurately identify different species of plant seedlings based on their images. By leveraging IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service, this project classifies plant seedlings into categories like Broadleaf, Grass, Soybean, and more. This tool can be beneficial in agriculture for identifying crops at early stages and taking timely actions.
